  1. Time complexity is about how much time you codes take to run on devices regardless of configarations. 
  2. It is estimated on steps of your codes. 

```
int a = 10;
int b = 20; 
int sum = a + b; 
```
  3. Grammer of Time complexity
  - Always calculate for worst case 
  - Ignore the constants 
  ```
  O(n + m + 100 + 2) -> O(n + m)
  ```
  4. Complexity comes from loops, variable steps are ignored. 

2. How Time is Calculated from Time Complexity
O(n ^10^)

  ```

  O(log^N^)
