Certainly! Here's the step-by-step algorithm for the Depth-First Search (DFS) implemented in your code:

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm:

1. **Initialize Data Structures:**
   - Create a 2D array `a` to represent the grid.
   - Create a 2D boolean array `vis` to track visited cells in the grid.
   - Create a vector `d` representing four possible directions: right, left, up, and down.

2. **Grid Dimensions:**
   - Read the number of rows (`row`) and columns (`col`) of the grid.

3. **Input Grid:**
   - Input the elements of the grid (`a`) from the user.

4. **Starting Position:**
   - Read the starting position `(si, sj)` from the user.

5. **DFS Function (`dfs`):**
   - The `dfs` function takes the current cell coordinates `(si, sj)` as input.
   - Print the current cell coordinates `(si, sj)`.
   - Mark the current cell as visited by setting `vis[si][sj]` to `true`.
   - Explore each neighbor in the four directions using the vector `d`.
     - For each neighbor, calculate new coordinates `(ci, cj)` based on the direction.
     - Check if the new coordinates are valid and the cell is not visited.
     - If valid and not visited, recursively call `dfs` with the new coordinates.

6. **Main Function:**
   - Initialize the `vis` array to `false` using `memset`.
   - Call the `dfs` function with the starting position `(si, sj)`.

### Explanation:

- The algorithm performs a Depth-First Search on a grid starting from a specified cell.
- It uses recursion to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- The `valid` function checks whether a set of coordinates is within the grid boundaries.
- The algorithm prints the order in which cells are visited during the DFS traversal.

This DFS algorithm is commonly used for graph traversal and exploration, and it's adapted here for a 2D grid. The sequence of visited cells represents the order in which DFS explores the grid.
